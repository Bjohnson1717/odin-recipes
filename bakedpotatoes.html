    <h2>Description</h2>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>coarse kosher salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper</li>
                <li>garlic powder</li>
                <li>dried parsley</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rub potatoes with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. Place potatoes in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are soft, 40 to 50 minutes, depending on potato size.</li>
            <li>Slice potatoes lengthwise. Pinch both sides of each potato, using your hands and forcing potatoes to open up, until the fluffy insides come up. Place 1 tablespoon of butter into each potato.</li>
        </ol>
